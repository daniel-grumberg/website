Introduction

Today, we will be looking at the new flagship variadic types that are offered in modern C++ [[http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/tuple][~std::tuple~]] and [[http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant/variant][~std::variant~]].
This post is not meant to teach you how to implement your own variadic templates, if you are into that check out my [[file: ../variadic-templates/index.org][previous post]].
Instead, I focus on demonstrating the usage of the standard library's own variadic types, so don't sweat it if you are not a template meta-programming expert.

One of the main reasons variadic templates were introduced to the language in the C++11 standard was to enable the definitions of the product and sum types.
People refer to these as algebraic types due to the connection to algebra and set theory, but don't let that scare you away.
These are namely, ~std::tuple~ (introduced in C++11) and ~std::variant~ (introduced C++17) in that order.

Tuples are what you would expect if you have encountered them in other languages...

Introduction

How many of you use the ~printf~ family of functions? Quite a lot, I assume.
The functions come with some advantages over the standard output streams (~cout~, ~cerr~, etc): - They are plain C and write directly to the underlying POSIX file descriptor, they are thus thread-safe.
They are somewhat faster as they don't rely on operator overloading and thus dynamic dispatch through virtual function tables.
This StackOverflow [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17671772/c11-variadic-printf-performance][post]] should give you some numbers if you care.
Most people probably don't/shouldn't care about this.
They are ubiquitous, well-known, and specifying precision and width is arguably simpler than it is in the stream idiom.

However, ~printf~ and all its friends suffer from one big drawback, type safety, which keeps bringing people back to streams.
Have you ever provided ~printf~ or worse ~scanf~ the wrong format string for what you were trying to achieve? I know I have.....

This posts serves mostly as quick introduction to the syntax of variadic templates.
I will be shortly building upon this post to show you guys how to leverage this addition to the C++ meta-programming facilities to improve type-safety of your code.
I will also show you then how to use some the flagship new types in modern C++ that rely upon this facility [[http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/tuple][~std::tuple~]] and [[http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant/variant)][~std::variant~]].

Motivation

Variadic templates have been introduced to the language for roughly three reasons:

Define type-safe variadic functions. All of us have messed up using ~scanf~ at some point, and those of us who have ever written C99 or C++03 style variadic functions will know the pain that comes with automatic variadic argument promotions and the ~va_arg~ family of macros. Writing variadic macros is even more painful...
Define algebraic types without having to jump through too many hoops, that is ~std::tuple~ and ~std::variant~...
